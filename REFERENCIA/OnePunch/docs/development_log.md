### Critical Fixes: MySQL Stability & Agent Behavior Refinement
**Branch:** `dev` (Direct commits)
**Date:** January 3-4, 2026
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Problem Statement:**
After extended conversation sessions (10+ hours), the system experienced "MySQL server has gone away" errors during tool execution. Additionally, the agent exhibited two behavioral issues:
1. Scheduling appointments without user confirmation when preferred time was unavailable.
2. Failing to execute `send_email` when explicitly requested by users post-payment.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **MySQL Connection Timeouts**: ORM lazy-loading of `agent.features` after long periods triggered queries on expired DB sessions.
2. **Ambiguous Scheduling Prompt**: Agent interpreted "offer alternatives" as permission to auto-schedule.
3. **Weak Email Prompt**: Agent responded in chat instead of executing `send_email` tool when user requested email delivery.

**Actions Taken:**

**A. MySQL Connection Robustness (Critical)**
*   **Decoupled Tool Loading from ORM** (`services/langgraph_tools.py`, `services/langgraph_agent.py`):
    *   Modified `get_tools_for_agent()` to accept pre-computed `enabled_features` list (strings) instead of querying `agent.features` dynamically.
    *   Extract feature names **before** any rollback operations, eliminating lazy-load vulnerabilities.
    *   Result: ZERO ORM queries during long-running agent operations.
*   **Preventive Rollbacks in Critical Tools**:
    *   Added `db.session.rollback()` at the start of `send_email`, `lookup_customer`, `register_customer`, `paypal_create_order` to handle stale connections.
*   **Fixed Python Import Bug**:
    *   Corrected `datetime` module shadowing in `langgraph_agent.py` that caused `cannot access local variable 'datetime'` errors.

**B. Agent Behavior Improvements**
*   **Scheduling Confirmation Rule** (`services/langgraph_agent.py`):
    *   Added explicit instruction: "**ESPERA LA RESPUESTA DEL USUARIO. NO PROCEDAS HASTA QUE EL USUARIO ELIJA.**"
    *   Agent now **must** wait for user's explicit choice before scheduling when preferred time is unavailable.
*   **Payment Email Flow** (`services/langgraph_agent.py`):
    *   Strengthened prompt with: "**REGLA DE ORO**: Cuando el usuario pide 'envíame por correo', SIEMPRE debes ejecutar `send_email`. NO es opcional."
    *   Agent now reliably executes `send_email` when user requests post-payment summary.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Files Modified**:
    *   `services/langgraph_agent.py`: Import fix, feature extraction logic, prompt refinements.
    *   `services/langgraph_tools.py`: `get_tools_for_agent()` signature update, tool rollbacks.
    *   `services/email_service.py`: Preventive rollback before channel query.
*   **Database Access Pattern**: Tools maintain full DB access for business operations (customer lookup, appointments, transactions). Only configuration loading (agent features) was optimized.

**Verification:**
*   ✅ 10+ hour conversation sessions complete without MySQL errors.
*   ✅ Agent correctly presents scheduling options and waits for user confirmation.
*   ✅ Email delivery works reliably post-payment when user requests it.
*   ✅ All payment, calendar, and RAG integrations function normally.

**Impact:**
This fix ensures long-term system stability for production deployments, particularly for persistent channels (WhatsApp, Telegram) where conversations span multiple days.

                                       ↓
                              Voice Agent (voice_agent.py)
                              OpenAI Realtime API (gpt-4o-realtime-preview)
```

**Actions Taken:**
*   **LiveKitService** (`services/livekit_service.py`):
    - Implemented room creation with `RoomServiceClient`.
    - SIP dialing with `SipService.create_sip_participant`.
    - Async bridge via `asyncio.run()` for Flask compatibility.
*   **Voice Agent** (`voice_agent.py`):
    - OpenAI Realtime API (`gpt-4o-realtime-preview`) for low-latency speech-to-speech.
    - BVCTelephony noise cancellation for SIP audio quality.
    - Spanish greeting and conversational persona.

    - Telephony provider switch (Twilio vs LiveKit).
    - [x] Agents: Show/Hide toggles and persistence
    - [x] Smart save logic to prevent masked secrets override.
*   **AgentService** (`services/agent_service.py`):
    - Added `make_call` tool with provider switching logic.
    - Injected user context from conversation for dynamic calling.

**Verification:**
*   ✅ Outbound call initiated from Admin Chat.
*   ✅ LiveKit SIP dispatched to Twilio Elastic SIP Trunk.
*   ✅ Phone rang and connected successfully.
*   ✅ Voice Agent spoke greeting in real-time (OpenAI Realtime API).

*   Ensured dropdown selections (Telephony Provider, LLM Provider, etc.) persist correctly.

---

### Feature: Dynamic Voice Agent Personalization
**Branch:** `feature/fix-ai-connections`
**Completed:** Dec 13, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Major Achievement:**
Voice Agent now dynamically loads personality, voice, tools, and background knowledge (RAG) based on the specific company and agent configuration in the database.

**Features:**
*   **Dynamic Context**: Agent reads room metadata to fetch its specific configuration from the internal API.
*   **Voice Matching**: Automatically maps Agent Gender defined in Company settings to OpenAI Realtime voices (Female → `coral`, Male → `echo`, Neutral → `alloy`).
*   **Tool Integration**: Enabled features (WhatsApp, Email, etc.) are dynamically loaded as function tools for the model.
*   **RAG Awareness**: Company knowledge base context is injected into the agent's system instructions.

**Technical Implementation:**
*   **Internal API**: Created `routes/voice_agent_api.py` (`/api/internal/voice-context/*`) to serve context securely to the local voice agent process.
*   **Architecture**:
    *   `LiveKitService` passes `agent_id` & `company_id` in Room Metadata.
    *   `voice_agent.py` fetches context from Flask API before starting the session.
    *   `voice_tools.py` allows the agent to execute actions (like `send_whatsapp`) by calling back to `AgentService` via the internal API.

**Verification:**
*   ✅ Verified context fetching from API.
*   ✅ Verified voice selection based on gender.
*   ✅ Verified tool loading based on enabled features.

*   **Comprehensive Settings Hub**: Refactored `settings.html` to serve as the central source of truth for all integrations.
    *   Added full configuration forms for Email (SMTP/IMAP), Google Service Account, Twilio, and LiveKit.
    *   Implemented robust `loadSettings` logic to pre-fill all domains from the database.
*   **Credential Management**:
    *   **Separation of Concerns**: Split Twilio configuration into distinct "WhatsApp" and "Voice" sections to prevent credential overwrites between services.
    *   **Security UI**: Implemented "Show/Hide" toggles and defensive merge logic to ensure masked secrets (`********`) are never saved back to the database, preserving actual values.
    *   **SendGrid Removal**: Fully deprecated SendGrid in favor of a unified Custom SMTP/IMAP email channel.
*   **UI/UX Fixes**:
    *   Fixed `channels.html` regression where "Connect" buttons were unresponsive due to syntax errors.
    *   Resolved nesting issues in Voice Modal that caused "ghost" phone number fields to appear.
    *   Restored accurate "Connected" status badges across all channels.
*   **Performance**:
    *   **Voice Agent Startup**: Fixed `TimeoutError` in `voice_agent.py` by implementing global caching for the Pinecone client in `RAGService`, reducing context load time from ~9s to <1s.

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Actions Taken:**

*   **Critical Fixes**:
    *   Removed duplicate `return jsonify(response)` statement in `routes/voice_agent_api.py`.
    *   **Security Enhancement**: Added `require_internal_token` decorator to protect internal API endpoints. Token verified via `X-Internal-Token` header against `INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` env variable.
    *   Filtered sensitive API keys from voice agent context response - now only returns `telephony_provider`, not full secrets.
    *   Implemented AgentService processing for SMS webhook (`/webhooks/sms`) - now provides AI responses instead of static text.
    *   Implemented AgentService processing for Voice webhook (`/webhooks/voice/process`) - now provides AI responses during calls.

*   **Tool Fixes & Improvements**:
    *   Fixed `send_whatsapp` tool schema - was incorrectly describing email parameters (subject, body) instead of WhatsApp (to, message).
    *   Enhanced `schedule_meeting` tool: Now integrates with `GoogleCalendarIntegration` when service account is configured. Falls back to mock with informative note.
    *   Enhanced `check_inventory` tool: Now integrates with `GoogleSheetsIntegration` when service account and `inventory_spreadsheet_id` are configured. Falls back to mock with informative note.
    *   Enhanced `create_payment_link` tool: Now integrates with `PayPalService`. Falls back to mock link on error.

*   **Codebase Cleanup**:
    *   Removed duplicate `python-docx` entry from `requirements.txt`.
    *   Added `INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` to `.env.example` with documentation.
    *   Updated `voice_agent.py` and `voice_tools.py` to include `X-Internal-Token` header in API calls.

**Verification:**
*   ✅ App imports and starts successfully.
*   ✅ All modified files have valid Python syntax.

    *   **Backend**: Created `routes/employees.py` with full CRUD endpoints for `Employee` model.
    *   **Frontend**: Updated `employees.html` to replace placeholder logic with real API integration (Grid view, Add/Delete actions).
    *   **Config**: Registered new blueprint in `app.py`.

*   **Security Hardening**:
    *   **Voice Tools**: Updated `check_inventory` and `create_payment_link` in `voice_tools.py` to use `X-Internal-Token` header for authentication, matching the new security standard.

**Verification:**
*   ✅ `python -c "from app import create_app..."` passed successfully.
*   ✅ Employee routes are registered and active.

### Feature: Voice Agent Purpose Persistence Fix
**Branch:** `feature/docs`
**Completed:** Dec 15, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Problem:**
When initiating outbound calls from the Admin Chat with a specific purpose (e.g., "Llama a X para preguntar sobre disponibilidad"), the voice agent would:
1. Say a generic greeting ("¿Hola? ¿Buenas tardes?")
2. State the purpose once
3. **But then ask "¿En qué puedo ayudarte?"** when the user responded, losing the purpose entirely.

**Root Cause:**
The `generate_reply(instructions=...)` method in LiveKit Agents only applies instructions for that **single response**. The agent's core instructions were never updated, so when the user responded, the agent reverted to its filler instructions.

**Solution:**
Added `agent.update_instructions(final_instructions)` call after loading context to **persist** the purpose into the agent's core instructions for the entire call duration.

**Actions Taken:**
*   **Modified** `voice_agent.py`:
    *   Added `agent.update_instructions(final_instructions)` after building the final instructions with purpose.
    *   Added debug logging to track instruction updates.

**Technical Reference:**
*   LiveKit GitHub Issue #4242: `update_instructions()` behavior documentation
*   LiveKit Docs: `generate_reply()` instructions are one-time, not persistent

**Verification:**
*   ✅ Voice agent now remembers the call purpose throughout the entire conversation.
*   ✅ Agent no longer asks generic "How can I help?" after user responds.

### Feature: Call Termination & Real-Time Reporting Fixes
**Branch:** `feature/docs`
**Completed:** Dec 16, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Problems Addressed:**
1.  **Phone Line Left Open:** `session.aclose()` terminated the AI agent but left the SIP phone call active.
2.  **Raw Transcript Report:** The call report was just a raw transcript, hard to read for admins.
3.  **No Real-Time Update:** Admin chat required manual page reload to see the call report.

**Solutions Implemented:**
1.  **SIP Hangup:** Rewrote `end_call` tool to use `RoomServiceClient.remove_participant()`, which forces the SIP disconnect.
2.  **LLM Summary:** Implemented GPT-4o-mini to generate a concise, professional executive summary of the call before reporting.
3.  **Real-Time WebSocket:** 
    *   Backend: Added `socketio.emit` broadcast on call completion.
    *   Frontend: Added `socket.io.js` library and event listeners in `chat.html`.

**Modified Files:**
*   `voice_agent.py`: New report logic with LLM summary.
*   `voice_tools.py`: New `end_call` implementation using LiveKit API.
*   `routes/voice_agent_api.py`: Added WebSocket broadcast.
*   `templates/base.html`: Added Socket.IO CDN.
*   `templates/dashboard/chat.html`: Added real-time listeners.

### Feature: LangGraph Integration (Dec 25, 2025)

*   **Objective**: Replace manual conversation history management with LangGraph for better memory persistence and reactive multi-agent workflows.
*   **New Files Created**:
    *   `services/langgraph_state.py` - State definitions (AgentState, ToolContext)
    *   `services/langgraph_tools.py` - 11 tools wrapped as @tool (RAG, PayPal, Email, Twilio, Calendar, HubSpot)
    *   `services/langgraph_agent.py` - Main StateGraph service with memory checkpointer
*   **Modified Files**:
    *   `services/agent_service.py` - Added LangGraph routing (default ON)
    *   `routes/webhooks.py` - Added channel parameter to all 6 `process_message` calls
    *   `routes/chat.py` - Added channel parameter to admin chat
    *   `requirements.txt` - Added `langgraph>=1.0.0`
*   **Architecture**:
    *   StateGraph with agent and tools nodes
    *   MemorySaver checkpointer for conversation persistence
    *   Fallback to legacy AgentService if LangGraph fails

### Feature: LangGraph Refinement & Payment Flow Fixes (Dec 28, 2025)

*   **Payment Flow Optimization**:
    *   **Prompt Engineering**: Implemented "Data Freshness Rule" (Regla de Frescura) to prevent the agent from using historical/stale payment amounts (e.g. confusing $100 with a past $50 transaction).
    *   **Verification Loop**: Softened PASO 2 logic to avoid infinite loops if the user has already confirmed their identity.
    *   **Clickable Links**: Enhanced `paypal_create_order` tool to return Markdown-formatted links (`[👉 Click aquí]`) for better UX in WebChat.
    *   **Widget Rendering**: Updated `widget.js` to automatically parse and render Markdown links as clickable anchors.

*   **System Stability & Database**:
    *   **MySQL Retry Logic**: Implemented robust `OperationalError` handling in `routes/webhooks.py`. The system now detects "MySQL server has gone away", performs a rollback, removes the dead session, and retries the save operation with a fresh connection.
    *   **Tool Reliability**: Added `db.session.rollback()` to `lookup_customer` and `register_customer` tools to prevent transaction blocks on error.
    *   **Bug Fix**: Fixed `DetachedInstanceError` in retry logic by capturing `conversation.id` before session usage.

*   **Customer Management**:
    *   **Model Update**: Added `@property full_name` to `Customer` model for easier template rendering.
    *   **Explicit Registration**: Added `register_customer` step in the agent prompt to ensure ID numbers are saved immediately.

*   **Status**: ✅ Tested & Verified in WebChat and Telegram.

### Feature: Robust Multi-Flow Agent & Universal Tools (Jan 03, 2026)

**Objective:**
Eliminate context confusion between Payment and Scheduling flows, fix hallucinations in RAG, and decouple tools for universal availability.

**1. Flow Context System (Anti-Hallucination/Anti-Confusion)**
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Implemented strict "Flow Context Rules" in `services/langgraph_agent.py`.
*   **Logic:**
    *   **Detection:** Agent detects keywords (`pagar`, `agendar`) and locks into `FLUJO_PAGO` or `FLUJO_AGENDA`.
    *   **Locking:** Once in a flow, cross-flow interruptions are blocked until completion.
    *   **Independence:** Instructions for disabled features are completely removed from the system prompt.

**2. The "Closing Phase" Implementation**
*   **Problem:** Agent would re-execute tasks (re-book/re-charge) when user said "Ok" to a post-transaction email offer.
*   **Solution:** Defined explicit **FASE DE CIERRE (POST-TRANSACCIÓN)** for both protocols.
    *   Once tool execution (Book/Link) succeeds, the Flow is marked as **TERMINATED**.
    *   Subsequent "Yes/Ok" confirmations are strictly routed to `send_email` or `goodbye`.
    *   **Result:** Robust 3-act structure (Collect -> Execute -> Close).

**3. Universal Tool Access & Feature Decoupling**
*   **Modified** `services/langgraph_tools.py`:
    *   **Email (`send_email`)**: Now available if `send_email` feature is ON, regardless of other flows. Usable for Payment, Agenda, or Info.
    *   **Customer Tools (`lookup`/`register`)**: Automatically injected if ANY enabled feature (Payment, Calendar, Email) requires identity.
    *   **RAG (`consult_knowledge_base`)**: Bug fix: replaced non-existent `search()` method call with correct `query()`. Now strictly prioritized for company info queries.

**4. Calendar & Timezone Optimizations**
*   **Smart Suggestions**: `check_availability` now returns slots surrounding the preferred time (2 before, 2 after) instead of just the first 5.
*   **Timezone Intelligence**: Injected Company Location (`city`, `country`) into prompt. Agent now converts User Time <-> Company Time explicitly.
*   **Integration**: Fixed `sendUpdates='all'` in Google Calendar API to ensure email invites are sent to attendees.
*   **Fix**: Added missing `pytz` import to tools.

**5. UX Enhancements**
*   **Email Formatting**: Implemented `markdown_to_html` converter. Emails sent by agent now render with professional HTML (bullets, bold, headers).
*   **Continuity Rule**: Added explicit instruction allowing the agent to "reset" context after a flow ends, enabling users to chain requests (e.g., Book -> Pay -> Ask Info) in one session.

**Status:** ✅ Tested & Verified context switching, locking, and email delivery.

### Feature: HubSpot CRM Process Integration (Jan 08, 2026)

**Branch:** `feature/crm-process`

**Objective:**
Implement comprehensive, real-time CRM synchronization with HubSpot, ensuring contact properties, lifecycle stages, and lead statuses are automatically updated based on user interactions.

**1. HubSpot Token Auto-Refresh**
*   Implemented automatic token refresh when `access_token` expires.
*   Added `_refresh_token()` method in `HubSpotService`.
*   Tokens are persisted to database on refresh.

**2. Contact Owner Assignment**
*   Added `crm.objects.owners.read` scope to OAuth flow.
*   Implemented `_get_owner_id_by_email()` to match company email to HubSpot owners.
*   New contacts are automatically assigned to the matching owner.

**3. Lifecycle Stage Automation**
*   **Lead** (Default): Set on contact creation.
*   **Opportunity**: Set when appointment is scheduled (`mark_as_scheduled`).
*   **Customer**: Set when transaction is completed (`update_lifecycle_to_customer`).

**4. Lead Status (`hs_lead_status`) Sync**
*   **NEW**: Default for new contacts.
*   **IN_PROGRESS**: Set on conversation sync.
*   **OPEN_DEAL**: Set on appointment scheduling.
*   **CONNECTED**: Set on payment completion.

**5. Contact Properties Sync**
*   **Phone Number**: Now synced via `create_or_update_contact`.
*   **Buying Role** (`hs_buying_role`): Added to `Customer` model with default `'End User'`.
    *   Auto-normalized to HubSpot internal values (e.g., `DECISION_MAKER`, `END_USER`).

**6. Real-Time Sync Triggers**
*   **Payment Completion** (`routes/payments.py`): Added HubSpot lifecycle update on PayPal capture success.
*   **Appointment Creation** (`schedule_appointment` tool): Already implemented.
*   **Customer Registration** (`register_customer` tool): Updated to sync immediately to HubSpot.
    *   Only sets `lead_status='NEW'` on fresh creation (no regression on updates).

**7. Backfill Script**
*   Created `scripts/sync_existing_customers.py` for bulk sync of existing customers.
*   Logic:
    *   Customers with completed transactions → `customer` / `CONNECTED`.
    *   Customers with appointments → `opportunity` / `OPEN_DEAL`.
    *   Customers with conversations → `lead` / `IN_PROGRESS`.
    *   Default → `lead` / `NEW`.

**Files Modified:**
*   `services/hubspot_service.py`: Token refresh, owner lookup, lifecycle methods.
*   `services/langgraph_tools.py`: `register_customer` HubSpot sync logic.
*   `routes/hubspot_auth.py`: Added `crm.objects.owners.read` scope.
*   `routes/payments.py`: Added real-time HubSpot sync on payment success.
*   `integrations/hubspot.py`: Added `hs_lead_status` to default search properties.
*   `models/customer.py`: Added `buying_role` field.

**Verification:**
*   ✅ Owner assignment verified (`86906918` for `jonnathan.ypg@gmail.com`).
*   ✅ Lifecycle stage transitions verified.
*   ✅ Lead status transitions verified.
*   ✅ Buying role sync verified (`END_USER`).
*   ✅ Backfill script executed successfully for 2 customers.

**Scripts Cleanup:**
*   Deleted 10 verification/debug scripts created during development.
*   Retained 6 utility scripts: `sync_existing_customers.py`, `backfill_emails.py`, `link_and_resolve_orphans.py`, `fix_contact_info.py`, `create_email_table.py`, `resolve_old_conversations.py`.

**Status:** ✅ Complete. Ready for merge to `dev`.
